A project to create social media style comments list using various react components which includes rendering the image of the user, user name, time at which the comment was posted, and the comment itself. The project showcases the resusability of react components, using props to pass content to children compononents, as well as how to generate and incorporate random data generated by the Faker Library. The comment styling has been taken from Semantic-UI.
